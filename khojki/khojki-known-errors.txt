1. Sequences of <shadda, vowel sign e> and <shadda, vowel sign ai> result in glyph clashes. Need to produce new glyphs for ligatures of these signs.

2. Sequences of <sa, shadda> followed by <shadda>, <nukta>, etc. result in glyph clashes. This is due to precomposed glyphs for <sa, shadda> and related vowel ligatures. Need to define rules in the GDL for handling these sequences.

3. Various glyphs are stored in the PUA. These need to be detached from their current code points.
